3. I want to be professional programeer. In early years old I was fond of computer science, solved many examples on Pascal. But as soon as I ended school, I was stopped getting involved in programming, because entered the university, the faculty of engineering(non-programming). And now, I want to return in early years and show everyone that I can become a great specialist. 
4. I was completed some courses of HTML, CSS, a little bit JS (paid courses HTMLacademy, freecodecamp, Grasshopper). But I need to understand how to use this knowledge. A couple of years ago I could add that I know Pascal, but now I can't write the first line. And I know some designer's programm: Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, CorelDraw, a little bit Adobe After Effects and Cinema 4D.
5. [Codepen](https://codepen.io/ezzik/pen/wvwmmbe) (this is done on the WebCademy course)
6. As I wrote above, I attended some webinars, YouTube channels and interactive courses. For me, this is the first step to my dream. Although also in school I had a website on Ucoz, on which I changed color palette, content, added different applications (but now I donâ€™t remember what they were written on).
7. Fifth year of University (non-programming), interactive course by HTMLacademy, various webinars (WebCademy, Glo Academy), course by FreeCodeCamp (not completly)
8. I was learnd English in school. Now I rate my level as A2(Elementary level of English), maybe closer to B1.
